# üìÑ ArcadeActions Extension Library Requirements Document

---

## ‚úÖ Project Overview

The goal is to create a robust, modern **Actions system for the Arcade 3.x Python library**, inspired by Cocos2D's action system but reimagined to fit Arcade's physics, sprite, and delta-time-based architecture.

This system enables complex sprite behaviors (movement, rotation, scaling, fading, grouping, scheduling) in games like Space Invaders, Galaga, and Asteroids ‚Äî all using high-level declarative actions.

## üì¶ What's Included (Features)

| Module / Feature      | Why It's Included                                                    |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `base.py`             | Core `Action` class hierarchy and `ActionSprite` - the exclusive sprite class that supports actions |
| `composite.py`       | Composite actions for combining multiple actions (Sequence, Spawn, Loop) with support for empty composites and immediate completion |
| `game.py`            | Game state management and action scheduling integration |
| `group.py`           | `GroupAction` and `SpriteGroup` to coordinate synchronized sprite groups with automatic management (e.g., Space Invaders formations, Galaga attack waves) |
| `instant.py`          | Instantaneous actions (e.g., Hide, Show, Place, CallFunc) for sprite state changes |
| `interval.py`         | Time-based actions (e.g., MoveBy, MoveTo, RotateBy, RotateTo, ScaleTo, FadeTo, JumpBy, JumpTo) and action modifiers (Easing) that use real delta-time physics and smooth interpolation |
| `move.py`            | Complex movement actions (`Driver`, `WrappedMove`, `BoundedMove`) for arcade-style patterns |
| Delta-Time Compliance | All actions consume `delta_time` for frame-independent accuracy |
| Test Suite           | Pytest-based unit and integration tests to validate core and edge behavior |
| Demo Game           | Example Space Invaders prototype showcasing actions on player, enemies, bullets |

## üîÑ Property Update System

The Actions library handles two distinct property update systems:

### 1. ActionSprite Properties
Properties managed by the Actions system through `ActionSprite`:
- Position (direct updates in `update()`)
- Angle (direct updates in `update()`)
- Scale (direct updates in `update()`)
- Alpha (direct updates in `update()`)
- Custom properties

These properties are updated by:
1. Actions calculate changes in `start()`
2. Actions apply changes directly in `update()` using:
   - Elapsed time tracking
   - Rate-based interpolation
   - Proper pause state handling
3. Actions ensure clean completion in `stop()`

Note: `ActionSprite` is designed to manage only one action at a time. To achieve multiple behaviors simultaneously, use composite actions:
- `Spawn` (|) for parallel actions
- `Sequence` (+) for sequential actions
- `Repeat` (*) for repeating actions
- `Loop` for finite repetitions

This design choice simplifies the action management system and makes the behavior more predictable. When a new action is started, any existing action is automatically stopped.

### 2. Arcade Sprite Properties
Properties managed by Arcade's standard sprite system:
- Position (via `change_x`, `change_y`)
- Angle (via `change_angle`)
- Physics properties (via Pymunk integration)

These properties are updated by:
1. Arcade's sprite update system
2. Velocity-based movement
3. Physics integration

### Clear Separation of Concerns
- `ActionSprite` is the only class that can use Actions
- Regular `arcade.Sprite` uses Arcade's standard velocity system
- No mixing of the two systems on the same sprite
- Explicit documentation that Actions only work with `ActionSprite`

### Time Management
All property updates are managed through the `GameClock` system:
- Delta-time based updates for frame independence
- Proper pause state handling
- Consistent timing across all action types
- Support for action modifiers (Easing)

## üèóÔ∏è Code Quality Standards

### Core Design Principle: Zero Tolerance for Runtime Type Checking

**ZERO TOLERANCE for runtime type/attribute checking** - This includes:
- `hasattr()` for type discrimination
- `getattr()` with defaults for missing attributes
- `isinstance()` for runtime type checking
- EAFP with exception silencing (`except AttributeError: pass`)

**The Real Problem**: Unclear interfaces, not the checking pattern.

**The Solution**: Design interfaces so checking isn't needed through:
1. **Consistent base interfaces** with default values
2. **Clear protocols** guaranteeing expected methods/attributes  
3. **Composition patterns** eliminating optional attributes
4. **Unified interfaces** for similar objects (Action vs GroupAction)

### Exception: Genuine Decision Points

EAFP is acceptable ONLY for genuine decision points with real fallback logic:

```python
# ‚úÖ Acceptable - genuine fallback logic
try:
    return expensive_operation()
except ResourceNotAvailable:
    return cached_result()

# ‚ùå Forbidden - error silencing
try:
    obj.method()
except AttributeError:
    pass  # This is a code smell
```

### Interface Design Requirements

1. **Type Safety**
   - Use type hints on all public interfaces
   - Define protocols for duck-typed behavior
   - Prefer composition over inheritance for complex behaviors
   - Use Union types for multiple type support

2. **Consistency**
   - All similar objects must have the same interface
   - Required methods/attributes must be guaranteed by design
   - Optional behavior must be handled through composition, not checking

3. **Clarity**
   - Interface contracts must be clear from type signatures
   - No surprise missing attributes or methods
   - Predictable behavior without runtime inspection

### Legacy Code Migration

When refactoring existing code with excessive runtime checking:
1. Identify the root cause (unclear interfaces)
2. Design consistent interfaces for all involved types
3. Use protocols to formalize duck-typed behavior
4. Eliminate optional attributes through composition
5. Replace checking with proper interface design

### Examples in Codebase

For concrete examples of these principles in action, see:
- `actions/move.py` - BoundedMove class refactoring
- `tests/test_bounce_fix.py` - Test cases for proper interface usage
