"""Tests requiring optional dependencies.

This directory contains tests that require optional dependencies (like python-statemachine).
These tests are excluded from the main test run because they need extras installed.

Note: Many unit tests in tests/ also need display context (Xvfb) for sprite operations,
but they don't require optional dependencies.
